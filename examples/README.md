---

## üìñ Comprehensive Guides Included

### 1. Three-Profile System (`three-profile-system/`)

**What it does:**
- Manage 3 different heating modes
- Switch profiles via UI dropdown
- Automatic profile switching (optional)
- Different schedules per profile

**Perfect for:**
- Families with regular schedule
- Vacation homes (Away mode)
- Energy-conscious users
- Anyone who travels

**Example use case:**
> "When we go away for the weekend, switch to Away mode (19¬∞C). House warms up automatically 2 hours before we return on Sunday evening."

---

### 2. Hybrid External Sensors (`hybrid-external-sensors/`)

**Problem it solves:**
- Thermostats have 2-hour timeout for external sensors
- If no temperature update ‚Üí Falls back to internal sensor
- Different readings ‚Üí Single heater activates ‚Üí Inefficient

**Solution:**
- Dual-trigger automation (state change + time pattern)
- Real-time updates when temperature changes
- Keep-alive update every 10 minutes
- Thermostats never timeout!

**Perfect for:**
- Anyone using external temperature sensors
- Multi-thermostat rooms (living room with 4 TRVs)
- Preventing single-heater activation
- Reliable temperature control

**Example use case:**
> "Living room has 4 thermostats sharing 1 room sensor. Without keep-alive, if temperature is stable for 2+ hours, thermostats timeout and one heater activates alone. With hybrid automation, all 4 stay synchronized 24/7."

---

### 3. Advanced Scheduling (`schedules/`)

**What it does:**
- Create complex time-based schedules
- Different temps per room, per day, per time
- Easy CSV to YAML conversion
- Weekday vs weekend variations

**Perfect for:**
- Multi-room homes
- Different occupancy patterns
- Shift workers
- Detailed temperature control

**Example use case:**
> "Living room: 20¬∞C from 6:00-8:00 (morning), 17¬∞C during work hours, 21¬∞C evenings 18:00-23:00. Bedroom: Cold during day (17¬∞C), warm at night (19¬∞C). Office: Only warm during work hours Mon-Fri."

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. "Entity not found"**
- Check entity IDs are correct
- Use Developer Tools ‚Üí States to find exact names
- Entity IDs are case-sensitive

**2. "Invalid config"**
- Check YAML syntax (indentation matters!)
- Use YAML validator
- Check for typos in entity names

**3. "Schedule not switching"**
- Verify time format correct (HH:MM:SS)
- Check weekday specified (if using weekday schedules)
- Reload automations after changes

**4. "Automation not triggering"**
- Check automation is Enabled
- Verify trigger entity IDs correct
- Check automation Traces for errors

### Getting Help:

1. **Check logs:** Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Logs
2. **Check traces:** Automation ‚Üí Traces button
3. **Validate config:** Developer Tools ‚Üí YAML ‚Üí Check Configuration
4. **Test manually:** Automation ‚Üí Run actions button

## üí° Pro Tips

### Temperature Scheduling

**Start conservative:**
- Don't set too many time slots initially
- Test with 2-3 time periods per day
- Expand gradually as you learn patterns

**Common patterns:**
- Morning warmup: 1 hour before wake-up
- Day setback: 2-3¬∞C lower when away
- Evening comfort: 2 hours before bedtime
- Night setback: 1-2¬∞C lower while sleeping

### External Sensors

**Best practices:**
- Place sensor at average height (not floor/ceiling)
- Away from direct sunlight
- Away from drafts/doors
- Central location in room

**Multi-thermostat rooms:**
- Use hybrid automation (mandatory!)
- 10-minute keep-alive prevents timeout
- All thermostats stay synchronized

### Profile Usage

**Weekly Schedule:**
- Your normal routine
- Most time spent here
- Comfort + efficiency balance

**Away Mode:**
- Weekends away
- Vacations
- Extended absences
- Set 3-4¬∞C lower (19¬∞C typical)

**Holiday Mode:**
- Public holidays at home
- Saturday schedule (typically most relaxed)
- No work/school routine

---

## üìä Expected Results

### Energy Savings

**Typical savings:**
- Away mode: 25-30% reduction
- Night setback: 10-15% reduction
- Overall: 20-40% depending on schedule

**Payback period:**
- Smart thermostats: 1-2 years
- Full system: 2-3 years
- Ongoing savings forever

### Comfort Improvements

**Before automation:**
- Manual adjustments needed
- Inconsistent temperatures
- Wake to cold rooms
- Waste energy when away

**After automation:**
- House always at desired temp
- Wake to warm room
- No manual adjustments
- Energy saved automatically

  entity_id: binary_sensor.living_room_occupancy
  to: "on"
```

### Weather-Based Adjustments

```yaml
# Lower temps when sunny
condition:
  - condition: numeric_state

## üö® ISSUE #1: HACS Update Failed - Missing Release ZIP File

### Error Message
```
ERROR (MainThread) [custom_components.hacs] Download failed - Got status code 404 
when trying to download 
https://github.com/Mr4peX/hass-climate-scheduler-weekday/releases/download/3be373e/hass-climate-scheduler-weekday.zip

ERROR: Downloading Mr4peX/hass-climate-scheduler-weekday with version 3be373e 
failed with (Could not download, see log for details)
```

### Root Cause Analysis

**The problem:** HACS is trying to download a ZIP file from a GitHub release, but:

1. **You created a Git tag `v1.0.0`**, not a GitHub Release
2. **HACS expects a GitHub Release** with a ZIP file attached
3. **The commit hash `3be373e`** is being treated as a version
4. **No ZIP file exists** at that URL ‚Üí 404 error

### Why This Happened

When you have `zip_release: true` in `hacs.json`, HACS expects:

1. A **GitHub Release** (not just a tag)
2. A **ZIP file attached** to the release
3. The ZIP file named: `hass-climate-scheduler-weekday.zip`

**What you have:**
- ‚úÖ Git tag: `v1.0.0`
- ‚ùå GitHub Release: **MISSING**
- ‚ùå ZIP file: **MISSING**

### Solution: Create a GitHub Release

You need to convert your Git tag into a proper GitHub Release with a ZIP file.

#### Method 1: GitHub Web Interface (RECOMMENDED - 2 minutes)

1. **Go to GitHub:**
   ```
   https://github.com/Mr4peX/hass-climate-scheduler-weekday/releases
   ```

2. **Click "Draft a new release"**

3. **Fill in the form:**
   - **Tag:** Select `v1.0.0` (existing tag)
   - **Release title:** `Climate Scheduler Weekday v1.0.0`
   - **Description:**
     ```markdown
     ## üéâ Initial HACS Release - v1.0.0
     
     ### What's Included
     - ‚úÖ Climate Scheduler integration with weekday validation fix
     - ‚úÖ Support for multiple profiles (Weekly/Away/Holiday)
     - ‚úÖ 252 schedule entries support
     - ‚úÖ HACS ready with clean installation
     
     ### Installation via HACS
     1. Add custom repository: `https://github.com/Mr4peX/hass-climate-scheduler-weekday`
     2. Install "Climate Scheduler Weekday"
     3. Restart Home Assistant
     
     ### Documentation
     üìö Comprehensive examples and guides available on GitHub:
     - [CSV Template](https://github.com/Mr4peX/hass-climate-scheduler-weekday/tree/main/examples/schedules)
     - [Three-Profile System](https://github.com/Mr4peX/hass-climate-scheduler-weekday/tree/main/examples/three-profile-system)
     - [Hybrid External Sensors](https://github.com/Mr4peX/hass-climate-scheduler-weekday/tree/main/examples/hybrid-external-sensors)
     
     ### What Gets Installed
     HACS installs only the core integration (3 files, ~50KB). Examples remain on GitHub.
     ```

4. **IMPORTANT - Create Source Code ZIP:**
   - GitHub automatically creates `Source code (zip)` ‚úÖ
   - This is what HACS will download
   - No manual ZIP upload needed!

5. **Click "Publish release"**

#### Method 2: GitHub CLI (FAST - 30 seconds)

```powershell
# Navigate to your repo
cd Z:\TradingView\Kiwwi\HomeAsistentGreen\hass-climate-scheduler-main

# Create release from existing tag v1.0.0
gh release create v1.0.0 `
  --title "Climate Scheduler Weekday v1.0.0" `
  --notes "Initial HACS release with weekday validation fix and three-profile system support"
```

GitHub will automatically generate the source code ZIP file.

### Verification Steps

After creating the release:

1. **Check GitHub Releases page:**
   ```
   https://github.com/Mr4peX/hass-climate-scheduler-weekday/releases
   ```
   - Should see "v1.0.0" release
   - Should see "Source code (zip)" download link

2. **Test ZIP URL manually:**
   ```
   https://github.com/Mr4peX/hass-climate-scheduler-weekday/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.zip
   ```
   - Should download ZIP file (not 404)

3. **Try HACS update again:**
   - Open Home Assistant ‚Üí HACS
   - Find "Climate Scheduler Weekday"
   - Click "Update information" (refresh)
   - Click "Update" button
   - Should download successfully! ‚úÖ

### Technical Details

**HACS ZIP Release Mechanism:**

When `zip_release: true` in `hacs.json`, HACS:
1. Checks for latest GitHub Release
2. Downloads: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/archive/refs/tags/{tag}.zip`
3. Extracts to `custom_components/climate_scheduler/`

**Why 404 happened:**
```
HACS tried: /releases/download/3be373e/hass-climate-scheduler-weekday.zip
            ‚ùå Wrong URL format - this is for attached assets

Should be:  /archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.zip
            ‚úÖ Correct URL for source code zip
```

## üö® ISSUE #2: Automation Failures - Zigbee Message Queue Overload

### Error Messages

```
ERROR: Living Room - External Sensor (Hybrid): Error executing script. 
Error for call_service at pos 1: Failed to send request: 
ZIGBEE_MAX_MESSAGE_LIMIT_REACHED: 3075

ERROR: Cam Luca - Sync External Temp to Thermostat (Hybrid): 
Failed to enqueue message: ZIGBEE_MAX_MESSAGE_LIMIT_REACHED: 3075

ERROR: Birou - Sync External Temperature (Hybrid): 
Failed to enqueue message: ZIGBEE_MAX_MESSAGE_LIMIT_REACHED: 3075

ERROR: Dormitor - Sync Temp to 2xThermostat (Hybrid): 
Failed to enqueue message: ZIGBEE_MAX_MESSAGE_LIMIT_REACHED: 3075
```

### Root Cause Analysis

**The problem:** Your Zigbee network is being **FLOODED** with messages!

**What's happening:**

1. **4 hybrid automations** running
2. Each automation has **2 triggers:**
   - State change (every temp change)
   - Time pattern (every 10 minutes)
3. **8 thermostats** receiving updates
4. All firing at the same time ‚Üí **message queue overflow**

**Zigbee coordinator has a message queue limit:**
- Maximum messages in queue: ~100-200 (depends on coordinator)
- Error code `3075` = **ZIGBEE_MAX_MESSAGE_LIMIT_REACHED**
- Your automations exceeded this limit

### Why This Happened

**Timeline of failure (from logs):**

| Time | Event | Result |
|------|-------|--------|
| 18:32:16 | Living Room automation fires | ‚ö†Ô∏è Device did not respond |
| 18:53:28 | Living Room automation fires again | ‚ö†Ô∏è Device did not respond |
| 19:12:35 | Living Room automation fires | ‚ùå **QUEUE FULL** |
| 19:20:01 | **ALL 4 automations fire together** | ‚ùå **QUEUE OVERLOAD** |
| 19:20:07 | Living Room automation tries again | ‚ùå Queue still full |

**At 19:20 (7:20 PM), all automations triggered at same time:**
- Time pattern: `:00` trigger (every 10 minutes)
- Temperature sensor updates
- 4 automations √ó 2-8 thermostats each = **20+ Zigbee messages**
- Queue exploded! üí•

### The Real Problem: Time Pattern Alignment

**All your automations use the same time pattern:**
```yaml
- platform: time_pattern
  minutes: "/10"  # Every 10 minutes at :00, :10, :20, :30, :40, :50
```

**This means:**
- ‚è∞ 19:00:00 ‚Üí ALL 4 automations fire together
- ‚è∞ 19:10:00 ‚Üí ALL 4 automations fire together
- ‚è∞ 19:20:00 ‚Üí ALL 4 automations fire together ‚Üê **THIS CAUSED THE CRASH**

### Solution: Stagger the Time Patterns

**Spread the automations across time to avoid queue overflow!**

#### Current (BAD - All fire together):
```
19:00:00 ‚Üí Living + Bedroom + Office + Child Room = üí• 20+ messages
19:10:00 ‚Üí Living + Bedroom + Office + Child Room = üí• 20+ messages
19:20:00 ‚Üí Living + Bedroom + Office + Child Room = üí• 20+ messages
```

#### Proposed (GOOD - Staggered every 2-3 minutes):
```
19:00:00 ‚Üí Living Room (4 thermostats)
19:02:00 ‚Üí Bedroom (2 thermostats)
19:05:00 ‚Üí Office (1 thermostat)
19:08:00 ‚Üí Child Room (1 thermostat)

19:10:00 ‚Üí Living Room (4 thermostats)
19:12:00 ‚Üí Bedroom (2 thermostats)
19:15:00 ‚Üí Office (1 thermostat)
19:18:00 ‚Üí Child Room (1 thermostat)
```

### Fix: Update Your Automations

#### Living Room (Keep every 10 minutes at :00):
```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.living_room_temperature
  - platform: time_pattern
    minutes: "/10"  # Fires at :00, :10, :20, :30, :40, :50
```

#### Bedroom (Offset by 2 minutes ‚Üí :02, :12, :22):
```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.dormitor_temperature
  - platform: time_pattern
    minutes: "2,12,22,32,42,52"  # Every 10 min, offset by 2
```

#### Office (Offset by 5 minutes ‚Üí :05, :15, :25):
```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.birou_temperature
  - platform: time_pattern
    minutes: "5,15,25,35,45,55"  # Every 10 min, offset by 5
```

#### Child Room (Offset by 8 minutes ‚Üí :08, :18, :28):
```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.luca_room_temperature
  - platform: time_pattern
    minutes: "8,18,28,38,48,58"  # Every 10 min, offset by 8
```

### Additional Fix: Add Rate Limiting

**Prevent rapid-fire updates when temp sensor changes quickly:**

```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.living_room_temperature
    for:
      seconds: 30  # ‚Üê ADD THIS: Wait 30 seconds before acting
  - platform: time_pattern
    minutes: "/10"
```

**Why this helps:**
- Ignores rapid fluctuations (sensor noise)
- Reduces message spam to thermostats
- Prevents queue overflow from sensor updates

### Complete Fixed Automation Example

**Living Room (with all fixes):**

```yaml
alias: Living Room - External Sensor (Hybrid) - FIXED
description: Sync external temperature with rate limiting and staggered timing
trigger:
  # State trigger with 30-second stabilization
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.living_room_temperature
    for:
      seconds: 30
  
  # Time trigger every 10 minutes (keep :00 timing)
  - platform: time_pattern
    minutes: "/10"

condition: []

action:
  - service: sonoff.send_command
    data:
      device: "{{ device_id(device_entity) }}"
      payload:
        currentTemperature: "{{ (states('sensor.living_room_temperature') | float * 100) | int }}"
    target:
      entity_id:
        - climate.living_calorifer_thermostat
        - climate.bucatarie_calorifer_thermostat
        - climate.hol_intrare_calorifer_thermostat
        - climate.hol_parter_calorifer_thermostat

mode: single  # ‚Üê ADD THIS: Prevents overlapping runs
max_exceeded: silent  # ‚Üê ADD THIS: Don't spam logs if triggered too fast
```

### Verification Steps

After implementing fixes:

1. **Deploy updated automations** with staggered time patterns
2. **Monitor logs** for 1 hour:
   ```
   Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Logs
   Filter: "automation" or "zigbee"
   ```
3. **Check for errors:**
   - ‚úÖ No more "ZIGBEE_MAX_MESSAGE_LIMIT_REACHED"
   - ‚úÖ No more "device did not respond"
   - ‚úÖ Automations fire at different times

4. **Verify execution times:**
   ```
   Developer Tools ‚Üí States
   Filter: automation.living_room
   Check "last_triggered" attribute
   ```
   - Living: :00, :10, :20, :30, :40, :50
   - Bedroom: :02, :12, :22, :32, :42, :52
   - Office: :05, :15, :25, :35, :45, :55
   - Child: :08, :18, :28, :38, :48, :58

### Additional Recommendations

#### 1. Check Zigbee Network Health

**Symptoms of overloaded Zigbee network:**
- ‚úÖ Devices not responding
- ‚úÖ Message queue full
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slow response times
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Devices going offline

**Solutions:**
- Add Zigbee routers (powered devices) to improve mesh
- Reduce polling frequency for battery devices
- Use Zigbee channel scan to avoid Wi-Fi interference

#### 2. Monitor Zigbee Queue

**Enable Zigbee debug logging temporarily:**

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    homeassistant.components.zha: debug
    zigpy: debug
```

**Look for:**
- Queue depth warnings
- Message retry attempts
- Network congestion alerts

#### 3. Alternative Solution: Reduce Update Frequency

If staggering doesn't fully solve it, increase intervals:

```yaml
# Instead of every 10 minutes
minutes: "/10"

# Try every 15 minutes
minutes: "0,15,30,45"

# Or every 20 minutes
minutes: "0,20,40"
```

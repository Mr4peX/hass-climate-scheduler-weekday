# 📝 README Update Summary

## ✅ Enhanced Main README Page

I've updated the main README.md to clearly explain the GitHub-only examples approach. Here's what was added:

---

## 🎯 New Section: Examples & Guides (Enhanced)

### What Users See Now:

```markdown
## 📚 Examples & Guides

> 💡 Important: HACS installs only the integration code (clean and minimal). 
> Examples and guides are available on GitHub for you to browse, read, and 
> download as needed. This keeps your Home Assistant installation clean while 
> providing comprehensive documentation when you need it.

**New to Climate Scheduler? Start here!** → Browse Examples on GitHub

We've created comprehensive guides and real-world examples:
- 📊 CSV Template - Edit schedules in Excel/LibreOffice
- 🏠 Complete System - 252 schedule entries (4 rooms, 8 thermostats)
- 🔄 Hybrid External Sensors - Prevent 2-hour timeout
- 📅 Three-Profile System - Weekly/Away/Holiday modes
- 📖 Step-by-Step Deployment - Beginner to advanced guides

### 📦 What Gets Installed via HACS

HACS installs only the core integration to keep your system clean:
✅ custom_components/climate_scheduler/ (3 Python files, ~50KB)
❌ Examples folder is not installed (browse on GitHub instead)
❌ Documentation is not installed (read online)

All examples and guides remain on GitHub for easy access without 
cluttering your Home Assistant installation!
```

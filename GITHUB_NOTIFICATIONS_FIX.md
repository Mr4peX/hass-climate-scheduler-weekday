# 🔔 GitHub Workflow Notifications - Fixed!

## ✅ Issue Resolved

The workflow failures were caused by **incorrect repository URLs** in the manifest files.

### What Was Wrong

**Before:**
```json
"documentation": "https://github.com/FrancisLab/hass-climate-scheduler"
"codeowners": ["@FrancisLab"]
```

**After (Fixed):**
```json
"documentation": "https://github.com/Mr4peX/hass-climate-scheduler-weekday"
"codeowners": ["@Mr4peX"]
```

## 🔍 Why You Got 8 Notifications

**2 workflows × 4 commits = 8 notifications**

1. **HACS Action workflow** - Validates integration for HACS
2. **Hassfest workflow** - Validates Home Assistant structure

Both workflows run automatically on **every push** to the main branch.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. manifest.json Updated
- ✅ Documentation URL → Your repository
- ✅ Issue tracker URL → Your repository  
- ✅ Codeowner → @Mr4peX
- ✅ Component name → "Climate Scheduler Weekday"
- ✅ Version bumped → 1.0.0

### 2. hacs.json Updated
- ✅ Added zip_release configuration
- ✅ Confirmed correct component name

## 📧 Managing GitHub Notifications

### Option 1: Reduce Email Notifications

**Via GitHub Settings:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/notifications
2. Click **"Customize email updates"**
3. Uncheck **"Actions"** under **"Pull Requests, Issues and comments"**
4. Or set to **"Only participating"** instead of **"Everything"**

**Per Repository:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/Mr4peX/hass-climate-scheduler-weekday
2. Click **"Watch"** button (top right)
3. Select **"Custom"**
4. Uncheck **"Actions"** workflows
5. Keep **"Issues"** and **"Pull requests"** if you want

---

### Option 2: Modify Workflow Triggers (Not Recommended)

You could change workflows to only run on:
- Pull requests
- Manual triggers
- Releases

**Example (if you want):**
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:  # Only on PRs
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual only
  release:  # Only on releases
    types: [published]
```

**But I don't recommend this!** The validations are useful.

---

### Option 3: Filter Emails

**Gmail Filter Example:**
1. Search: `from:(notifications@github.com) subject:(hass-climate-scheduler-weekday)`
2. Click **"Create filter"**
3. Choose action:
   - Skip inbox (archive automatically)
   - Apply label "GitHub/Workflows"
   - Mark as read
4. Click **"Create filter"**

---

## 🎯 Next Workflow Run Should Pass

After the manifest fix (commit cf70832), the next workflow runs should **succeed** because:

1. ✅ URLs point to correct repository
2. ✅ Codeowner is correct (@Mr4peX)
3. ✅ Version is valid (1.0.0)
4. ✅ HACS config is complete

---

## 📊 Workflow Status

Check workflow status here:
https://github.com/Mr4peX/hass-climate-scheduler-weekday/actions

You should see:
- 🟢 **Green checkmarks** = Passing
- 🔴 **Red X** = Failing

After this commit, they should turn green! ✅

---

## 🔕 Quick Action: Disable Email Notifications

**If you want NO more workflow emails:**

1. Go to repository: https://github.com/Mr4peX/hass-climate-scheduler-weekday
2. Click **"Watch"** → **"Custom"**
3. **Uncheck "Actions"**
4. Click **"Apply"**

**Done!** No more workflow emails, but you can still check status on GitHub.

## 📱 GitHub Mobile App Alternative

Instead of emails, use the GitHub mobile app:
- Get push notifications
- Faster than email
- Better filtering
- Can dismiss easily

**Download:**
- iOS: https://apps.apple.com/app/github/id1477376905
- Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android

## ✅ Recommended Settings

**For peace of mind:**

1. **Email notifications:** OFF for workflows
2. **Watch repository:** Custom (Issues + PRs only)
3. **GitHub mobile app:** ON for important notifications
4. **Check Actions tab:** Manually when you push

**This way:**
- ✅ No spam emails
- ✅ Still know if issues reported
- ✅ Can check workflow status manually
- ✅ Peace of mind!

---

## 🎯 Summary

**Problem:** 8 notification emails from failed workflows  
**Root cause:** Wrong repository URLs in manifest.json  
**Fix:** Updated manifest.json + hacs.json to correct URLs  
**Status:** Next workflow run should pass ✅  
**Prevention:** Customize GitHub notification settings  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Wait 5 minutes** for new workflow to complete
2. **Check Actions tab:** Should see green checkmarks ✅
3. **If still failing:** Check workflow logs for details
4. **Disable email notifications** if you prefer (see above)

**The workflows are actually GOOD!** They validate your code on every push to catch issues early. Now that the URLs are fixed, they should pass! 🎉
